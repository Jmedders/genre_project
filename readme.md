### This was my first quarter project at Galvanize
### The goal of the project is to increase user knowledge on genres of music, by giving information about the genre and bands of the genre.
#### Simply type in a genre of music (dream pop for example). You'll find info about the genre from the Last.FM API. Click on one of the bands that appear, and you'll see information about the band.
#### If you have Spotify, simply use the iframe associated with that band to listen and gain an understanding of the sounds of the genre.
#### Fork/clone, open index.html
#### Or see the deployed app at: https://genrestuff.firebaseapp.com/
